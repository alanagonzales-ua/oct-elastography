# oct-elastography

This repository contains the files needed to analyze optical coherence elastography data as detailed in the manuscript under review titled "Optical coherence tomography and elastography for ex vivo visualization of early gastric cancer." It can be used to measure the displacement of a reference phantom layer under axial compression and calculate the strain.

### Contents
* **Phantom_thickness_automated.m**
	+ For each XZ slice in the input OCT image, this program calculates the thickness of the phantom reference layer at each X coordinate across the slice.
* **Average_phantom_thickness.m**
  + This program plots the average phantom reference layer thickness accross the phantom vs. the amount of compression.
* **Best_linear_range.m**
  + From the file generated by Average_phantom_thickness.m, this program finds the range of compression where average phantom reference layer thickness is most linearly changing with increasing compression.
* **turbo_colormap_1024.mat**
  + This .mat file contains the custom Turbo colormap used to map the stress measurements generated in Stress_map.m
* **Stress_map.m**
  + This program calculates the strain of the reference layer at each XY coordinate in the 3D image stack, multiplies strain values by the Young's modulus of the reference material to calculate stress, and generates a Turbo colormap of the stress values.
